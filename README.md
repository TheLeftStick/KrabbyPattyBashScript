# Krabby Patty Bash Script

This was a fun Bash Script assignment I did for my internship! The purpose of this project was to practice my bash scripting skills and become more familiar with Linux Bash commands. It demostrates the usage of bash scripting varibles, conditional statements, and loops.

# To run bash script:
1. Download the file in desired directory
2. In the terminal, enter `bash KrabbyPattyBashScript.sh` or `./myFirstBashScript.sh`

# How it should function:
1. Ask user for Yes/No input
2. If Yes, display the list of Krabby Patty ingredients from bottom to top of the burger
3. If No, display message of disheartened Mr. Krabs 
4. Displays my general contact information
5. End
